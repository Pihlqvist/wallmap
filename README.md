## Short description of the project
This is an application where users can create a personal digital traveller map, to pin, store and show the images, information and dates of the places they have visited worldwide, and share that with friends. Friends can then comment and chat with user about each visited place. Pins can be categorised depending on travel reason (business, vacation, etc). 

## What has been done
We have done the main components and layout, user creation and login (authentication), and adding new visited places (not images yet). The places show up on the map as pins which can be clicked on and then pops up a place view/modal with the info of the place (with currently a temp random photo). Also the user can click on List button that shows the list of places visited. The app is connected to Firebase (Authentication and Realtime Database) and deployed (demo) on Firebase.  

## What needs to be done
